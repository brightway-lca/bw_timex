This is a python package for [time-explicit Life Cycle Assessment](https://docs.brightway.dev/projects/bw-timex/en/latest/content/theory.html#terminology) that helps you assess the environmental impacts of products and processes over time. `bw_timex` builds on top of the [Brightway LCA framework](https://docs.brightway.dev/en/latest).

## ‚ú® Features
This package enables you to account for:
- **Timing of processes** throughout the supply chain (e.g., end-of-life treatment occurs 20 years after construction)
- **Variable** and/or **evolving** supply chains & technologies (e.g., increasing shares of renewable electricity in the future)
- **Timing of emissions** (by applying dynamic characterization functions)

You can define temporal distributions for process and emission exchanges, which are then *automatically* propagated through the supply chain and mapped to corresponding time-explicit databases. The resulting time-explicit LCI reflects the current technology status within the production system at the actual time of each process. Also, `bw_timex` keeps track of the timing of emissions which means that you can apply [dynamic characterization functions](https://github.com/brightway-lca/dynamic_characterization).

## üí° Use Cases
`bw_timex` is ideal for cases with:
- **Variable** or strongly **evolving production systems**
- **Long-lived** products
- **Biogenic** carbon
