@article{Mutel:2017,
abstract = {Brightway is an open source framework for Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) calculations in Python. The combination of a modular structure, the expressiveness and interactivity of Python and in particular Jupyter notebooks, and tuned calculation pathways allows for new research directions in Life Cycle Assessment. Brightway has been used in papers on meta-analysis of many inventory datasets (Wernet et al. 2011), regionalized LCA (Mutel, Pfister, and Hellweg 2011), and sensitivity analysis (Mutel, Baan, and Hellweg 2013). Brightway consists of three main modules: Brightway2-data (Mutel 2012c) manages how data is stored and accessed; Brightway2-calc (Mutel 2012b) does static and Monte Carlo calculations; and Brightway2-IO (Mutel 2015c) handles the import and export of LCA data from various sources. In addition to these libraries, helper libraries provide documentation and application examples (Mutel 2012a), support for parameterized inventories (Mutel 2015b), and a format for LCA data in arrays (Mutel 2013). A web page (Mutel 2016), documentation (Mutel 2015a), and a development blog (Mutel 2014) are also available.},

@article{Steubing:2021,
abstract = {Much progress has recently been made in modelling future background systems for LCA  by including future scenario data, e.g. from Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), into life cycle inventory (LCI) databases. A key problem is, however, that this yields potentially dozens of scenario LCI databases (i.e. LCI databases that represent different scenarios and reference years), instead of a single background database, which is very impractical for LCA modelling purposes. This paper proposes an approach to overcome this problem.},

The Activity Browser provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to the brightway LCA framework and makes common tasks such as managing projects and databases, modeling life cycle inventories, and analyzing LCA results easier and more intuitive. In addition, it provides advanced features for LCA modeling and data analyses and thus facilitates state-of-the-art LCA research. It can be extended to implement novel LCA modeling approaches and analyses as needed.},

@article{Joyce:2022,
abstract = {While it may be impossible to accurately predict what the world will look like in the future, we can be certain that it will be different from the world of today. By extension, we know that using today's data in life cycle assessment (LCA) studies claiming to represent future scenarios is problematic. For the future impact of products to be estimated in a consistent and meaningful manner in LCA, the background system, most commonly the ecoinvent database, needs to be projected into the future alongside the foreground system modeled in a given study. Futura is a new piece of open-source software which allows LCA practitioners to create and share novel background databases representing arbitrary scenarios. It allows users to import a base database and then start making targeted changes. These changes take three main forms—adding new technologies, regionalizing new or existing technologies, and altering market compositions. All changes made are automatically added to a "recipe." This recipe file can be shared publicly. This recipe can be imported by other users and used to exactly recreate the modified database. The additive and transparent nature of this system means that initially simple scenarios can be built upon by others to progress toward more comprehensive scenarios in a stepwise manner. The inability to build on the work of others is a serious barrier to the progress of the LCA field. Futura goes some way to reduce this barrier in the field of prospective LCA.},
