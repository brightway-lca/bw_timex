class TimexLCA:
    """
    Class to perform time-explicit LCA calculations.

    A TimexLCA contains the LCI of processes occurring at explicit points in time. It tracks the timing of processes,
    relinks their technosphere and biosphere exchanges to match the technology landscape at that point in time,
    and also keeps track of the timing of the resulting emissions. As such, it combines prospective and dynamic LCA
    approaches.

    TimexLCA first calculates a static LCA, which informs a priority-first graph traversal. From the
    graph traversal, temporal relationships between exchanges and processes are derived. Based on
    the timing of the processes, bw_timex matches the processes at the intersection between
    foreground and background to the best available background databases. This temporal relinking is
    achieved by using datapackages to add new time-specific processes. The new processes and their
    exchanges to other technosphere processes or biosphere flows extent the technosphere and
    biosphere matrices.

    Temporal information of both processes and biosphere flows is retained, allowing for dynamic
    LCIA.

    TimexLCA calculates:
     1) a static "base" LCA score (`TimexLCA.base_score`, same as `bw2calc.lca.score`),
     2) a static time-explicit LCA score (`TimexLCA.static_score`), which links LCIs to the
        respective background databases, but without dynamic characterization of the time-explicit inventory
     3) a dynamic time-explicit LCA score (`TimexLCA.dynamic_score`), with dynamic inventory and
        dynamic characterization. These are provided for radiative forcing and GWP but can also be
        user-defined.
    

    Example
    -------
    >>> demand = {('my_foreground_database', 'my_process'): 1}
    >>> method = ("some_method_family", "some_category", "some_method")
    >>> database_dates = {
            'my_background_database_one': datetime.strptime("2020", "%Y"),

            'my_foreground_database':'dynamic'
        }
    >>> tlca = TimexLCA(demand, method, database_dates)
    >>> tlca.build_timeline() # has many optional arguments
    >>> tlca.lci()
    >>> tlca.static_lcia()

        Calculates the time-explicit LCI.

        There are two ways to generate time-explicit LCIs:
        If `expand_technosphere' is True, the biosphere and technosphere matrices are expanded by inserting
        time-specific processes via the `MatrixModifier` class by calling `TimexLCA.build_datapackage().
        Otherwise ('expand_technosphere' is False), it generates a dynamic inventory directly from the
        timeline without technosphere matrix calculations.

        Next to the choice above concerning how to retrieve the time-explicit inventory, users
        can also decide if they want to retain all temporal information at the biosphere level
        (build_dynamic_biosphere = True).
        Set `build_dynamic_biosphere` to False if you only want to get a new overall score of
        the time-explicit inventory and don't care about the timing of the emissions.
        This saves time and memory.

        Parameters
        ----------
        build_dynamic_biosphere: bool

            if False, creates no new technosphere, but calculates the dynamic inventory directly

        Calculates dynamic LCIA with the `DynamicCharacterization` class using the dynamic inventory
        and dynamic characterization functions. Dynamic characterization is handled by the separate
        package `dynamic_characterization` (https://dynamic-characterization.readthedocs.io).

        Dynamic characterization functions in the form of a dictionary {biosphere_flow_database_id:
        characterization_function} can be given by the user.
        If none are given, a set of default dynamic characterization functions based on IPCC AR6 are
        provided from `dynamic_characterization` package. These are mapped to the biosphere3 flows
        of the chosen static climate change impact category. If there is no characterization
        function for a biosphere flow, it will be ignored.

        Two dynamic climate change metrics are supported: "GWP" and "radiative_forcing".
        The time horizon for the impact assessment can be set with the `time_horizon` parameter,
        defaulting to 100 years. The `fixed_time_horizon` parameter determines whether the emission
        time horizon for all emissions is calculated from a specific starting point `time_horizon_start`
        (`fixed_time_horizon=True`) or from the time of the emission (`fixed_time_horizon=False`).
        The former is the implementation of the Levasseur approach
        (see https://doi.org/10.1021/es9030003), while the latter is how conventional LCA is done.

        Parameters
        ----------
        metric : str, optional
            the metric for which the dynamic LCIA should be calculated. Default is
            "radiative_forcing". Available: "GWP" and "radiative_forcing"
        time_horizon: int, optional
            the time horizon for the impact assessment. Unit is years. Default is 100.
        fixed_time_horizon: bool, optional
            Whether the emission time horizon for all emissions is calculated from the functional
            unit (fixed_time_horizon=True) or from the time of the emission
            (fixed_time_horizon=False). Default is False.
        time_horizon_start: pd.Timestamp, optional
            The starting timestamp of the time horizon for the dynamic characterization. Only needed
            for fixed time horizons. Default is datetime.now().
        characterization_functions: dict, optional
            Dict of the form {biosphere_flow_database_id: characterization_function}. Default is
            None, which triggers the use of the provided dynamic characterization functions based on
            IPCC AR6 Chapter 7.
        characterization_function_co2: Callable, optional
            Characterization function for CO2 emissions. Necessary if GWP metric is chosen. Default
            is None, which triggers the use of the provided dynamic characterization function of CO2
            based on IPCC AR6 Chapter 7.
        use_disaggregated_lci: bool, optional
            Whether to use the disaggregated background LCI for the dynamic LCIA. Default is False.
            Use True if you want to perform a contribution analysis on the disaggregated background.

        Returns
        -------
        pandas.DataFrame
            A DataFrame with the characterized inventory for the chosen metric and parameters.
