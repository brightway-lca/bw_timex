class TimexLCA:
    """
    Class to perform time-explicit LCA calculations.

    A TimexLCA retrieves the LCI of processes occuring at explicit points in time and relinks their technosphere
    exchanges to match the technology landscape at that point in time, while keeping track of the timing of the
    resulting emissions. As such, it combines prospective and dynamic LCA approaches.

    TimexLCA first calculates a static LCA, which informs a priority-first graph traversal. From the graph traversal,
    temporal relationships between exchanges and processes are derived. Based on the timing of the processes, bw_timex
    matches the processes at the intersection between foreground and background to the best available background
    databases. This temporal relinking is achieved by using datapackages to add new time-specific processes. The new
    processes and their exchanges to other technosphere processes or biosphere flows extent the technopshere and
    biosphere matrices.

    Temporal information of both processes and biosphere flows are retained, allowing for dynamic LCIA.

    TimexLCA calculates:
     1) a static LCA score (`TimexLCA.static_lca.score`, same as `bw2calc.lca.score`),
     2) a static time-explicit LCA score (`TimexLCA.score`), which links LCIs to the respective background databases but without additional temporal dynamics of the biosphere flows,
     3) a dynamic time-explicit LCA score (`TimexLCA.dynamic_score`), with dynamic inventory and dynamic charaterization factors. These are provided for radiative forcing and GWP but can also be user-defined.

    Example
    -------
    >>> demand = {('my_foreground_database', 'my_process'): 1} #replace here with your functinal unit
    >>> method = ("some_method_family", "some_category", "some_method")    #replace here with your method
    >>> database_date_dict = {'my_database': datetime.strptime("2020", "%Y"),
                              'my_foreground_database':'dynamic'} #replace here with your database dates
    >>> bw_timex = TimexLCA(demand, method, database_date_dict)
    >>> bw_timex.build_timeline() # you can pass many optional arguments here, also for the graph traversal
    >>> bw_timex.lci()
    >>> bw_timex.static_lcia()
    >>> bw_timex.static_score
    >>> bw_timex.dynamic_lcia(metric="radiative_forcing") # different metrics can be used, e.g. "GWP", "radiative_forcing"
    >>> bw_timex.dynamic_score
