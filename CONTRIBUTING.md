# Contributing

We welcome contributions! If you have any questions, [open a discussion](https://github.com/TimoDiepers/timex/discussions) or [get in touch directly with the `bw_timex` developers ](mailto:timo.diepers@ltt.rwth-aachende.de)


## Contributing to the code, examples or documentation

If you want to contribute to the development our code with a new feature, want to share your timex-example or add to the documentation, please follow the [GitHub contribution workflow (fork, branch, PR)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests) to share your work.

## Report bugs or errors

Something is not working as expected? You have two options:

### 🥈 Report an error
Please open a new issue in the `bw_timex` [repository](https://github.com/TimoDiepers/timex/issues), describing the error and where you found it. 
A member of the bw_timex developer community will then take care of the issue, but it may take some time for your issue to be resolved.

### 🥇  Fix an error yourself
If you have a solution to the error, you can [create a fork](https://github.com/TimoDiepers/timex/forks) of the `bw_timex` repository, make your changes and [create a pull request](https://github.com/TimoDiepers/timex/pulls). The developers will assess the changes and be eternally grateful!
