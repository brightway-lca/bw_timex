# Getting Started

This section will help you quickly getting started with your time-explicit LCA project. We're keeping it simple here - no deep dives into how things work in the background, no exploring of all the features and options `bw_timex` has. Just a quick walkthrough of the different steps of a `TimexLCA`. Here's a rundown:

In the following sections, we'll walk through the steps 1-4, considering a very simple dummy system. If you directly want to look at a more complex example, take a look at our [example collection](../examples/index.md). If you're interested in the full details on how `bw_timex` works, you can also skip to our [Theory Section](../theory.md). For some general guidance on what kind of LCA is suitable for what kind of case, check out our [decision tree](../decisiontree.md).
