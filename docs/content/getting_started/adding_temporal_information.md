# Step 1 - Adding temporal information

To get you started with time-explicit LCA, we'll investigate this very simple production system with two "technosphere" nodes A and B and a "biosphere" node representing some CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. For the sake of this example, we'll assume that we demand Process A to run exactly once.
```{mermaid}

subgraph background[<i>background</i>]
    B(Process B):::bg
end

subgraph foreground[<i>foreground</i>]
    A(Process A):::fg
end

subgraph biosphere[<i>biosphere</i>]
    CO2(CO<sub>2</sub>):::bio
end

B-->|"3 kg \n &nbsp;"|A
A-.->|"5 kg \n  &nbsp;"|CO2
B-.->|"11 kg \n &nbsp;"|CO2

Now, if you want to consider time in your LCA, you need to somehow add temporal information. For time-explicit LCA, we consider two kinds of temporal information, that will be discussed in the following.

## Temporal distributions
To determine the timing of the exchanges within the production system, we add the `temporal_distribution` attribute to the respective exchanges. To carry the temporal information, we use the [`TemporalDistribution`](https://docs.brightway.dev/projects/bw-temporalis/en/stable/content/api/bw_temporalis/temporal_distribution/index.html#bw_temporalis.temporal_distribution.TemporalDistribution) class from [`bw_temporalis`](https://github.com/brightway-lca/bw_temporalis). This class is a *container for a series of amount spread over time*, so it tells you what share of an exchange happens at what point in time. So, let's include this information in our production system - first visually:
```{mermaid}
:caption: Temporalized example production system
flowchart LR
subgraph background[" "]
    B_2020(Process B):::bg
end

subgraph foreground[" "]
    A(Process A):::fg
end

subgraph biosphere[" "]
    CO2(CO<sub>2</sub>):::b
end

    B_2020-->|"dates:[-2,0,+4] years \n shares: [30%,50%,20%] * 3 kg "|A
    A-.->|"dates: [0,+1] years\n  shares: [60%,40%] * 5 kg"|CO2
    B_2020-.->|"dates:[0] years\n  shares: [100%] * 11 kg"|CO2

    classDef bg color:#222832, fill:#3fb1c5, stroke:none;
    classDef fg color:#222832, fill:#3fb1c5, stroke:none;
    classDef b color:#222832, fill:#9c5ffd, stroke:none;
    style foreground fill:none, stroke:none;
    style background fill:none, stroke:none;
    style biosphere fill:none, stroke:none;

```
:::{dropdown} <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;">Here's the code to add this information to our modeled production system in Brightway</style>
:icon: codescan

```python
import numpy as np
from bw_temporalis import TemporalDistribution
from bw_timex.utils import add_temporal_distribution_to_exchange

# Starting with the exchange between A and B
# First, create a TemporalDistribution with the time information from above
td_b_to_a = TemporalDistribution(
    date=np.array([-2, 0, 4], dtype="timedelta64[Y]"),
    amount=np.array([0.3, 0.5, 0.2]),
)

# Now add the temporal distribution to the corresponding exchange. In
# principle, you just have to do the following:
# exchange_object["temporal_distribution"] = TemporalDistribution
# We currently don't have the exchange_object at hand here, but we can
# use the utility function add_temporal_distribution_to_exchange to help.
add_temporal_distribution_to_exchange(
    temporal_distribution=td_b_to_a,
    input_code="B",
    input_database="background",
    output_code="A",
    output_database="foreground"
)

# Now we do the same for our other temporalized exchange between A and CO2
td_a_to_co2 = TemporalDistribution(
    date=np.array([0, 1], dtype="timedelta64[Y]"),
    amount=np.array([0.6, 0.4]),
)

# We actually only have to define enough fields to uniquely identify the
# exchange here
add_temporal_distribution_to_exchange(
    temporal_distribution=td_a_to_co2,
    input_code="CO2",
    output_code="A"
)
```
:::

## Time-specific process data

While the temporal information above tells us when the processes occur, we also need information on how our processes change over time. So, for our simple example, let's say our background process B somehow evolves, so that it emits less CO<sub>2</sub> in the future. To make it precise, we assume that the original process we modeled above represents the process state in the year 2020, emitting 11 kg CO<sub>2</sub>, which reduces to 7 kg CO<sub>2</sub> by 2030:


```{mermaid}
:caption: Temporalized example production system with two time-specific background processes B
flowchart LR
subgraph background[" "]
    B_2020(Process B \n 2020):::bg
    B_2030(Process B \n 2030):::bg
end

subgraph foreground[" "]
    A(Process A):::fg
end

subgraph biosphere[" "]
    CO2(CO<sub>2</sub>):::b
end
    B_2020-->|"dates:[-2,0,+4] years \n shares: [30%,50%,20%] * 3 kg"|A
    A-.->|"dates: [0,+1] years\n  shares: [60%,40%] * 5 kg"|CO2   
    B_2020-.->|"dates:[0] years\n shares: [100%] * <span style='color:#9c5ffd'><b>11 kg</b></span>"|CO2
    B_2030-.->|"dates:[0] years\n shares: [100%] * <span style='color:#9c5ffd'><b>7 kg</b></span>"|CO2

    classDef bg color:#222832, fill:#3fb1c5, stroke:none;
    classDef fg color:#222832, fill:#3fb1c5, stroke:none;
    classDef b color:#222832, fill:#9c5ffd, stroke:none;
    style foreground fill:none, stroke:none;
    style background fill:none, stroke:none;
    style biosphere fill:none, stroke:none;

```

:::{dropdown} <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;">Again, here's the code in case you're interested</span>
:icon: codescan

```python
bd.Database("background_2030").write(
    {
        ("background_2030", "B"): {
            "name": "B",
            "location": "somewhere",
            "reference product": "B",
            "exchanges": [
                {
                    "amount": 1,
                    "type": "production",
                    "input": ("background_2030", "B"),
                },
                {
                    "amount": 7,
                    "type": "biosphere",
                    "input": ("biosphere", "CO2"),
                },
            ],
        },
    }
)
```

So, as you can see, the processes at specific time steps reside within a separate normal Brightway database. To hand them to `bw_timex`, we just need to define a dictionary that maps the names of time-specific databases to the point in time that they represent:

```python
from datetime import datetime

# Note: The foreground does not represent a specific point in time, but should
# later be dynamically distributed over time
database_dates = {
    "background": datetime.strptime("2020", "%Y"),
    "background_2030": datetime.strptime("2030", "%Y"),
    "foreground": "dynamic",
}
```

:::{note}
You can use whatever data source you want for the time-specific process data. A nice package from the Brightway cosmos that can help you is [premise](https://premise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html).
