    "In this exercise notebook you will compare the climate performance of a battery electric vehicle (BEV) and an internal combustion engine car (ICEC), in a time explicit way, using different decarbonisation scenarios. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to have a fair comparison**, we will start from two existing Ecoinvent activities (listed below) and will add the temporal information as needed. This notebook will guide you through the steps needed to build the model. But if you are unsure, you can either ask the instructors or have a look at the solution notebook (Note that this just provides one solution, and there are often multiple ways to get to the same result, so we encourage you to use the way that is most intuitive to you!). \n",
